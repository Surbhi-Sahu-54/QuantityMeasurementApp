# UC14 – Temperature Measurement with Selective Arithmetic Support & IMeasurable Refactoring

**Date:** 23 Feb 2026

---

## Description

UC14 extends the **Quantity Measurement Application** to support **Temperature** alongside:

- Length  
- Weight  
- Volume  

Unlike these categories, **temperature has fundamentally different arithmetic rules**:

| Operation | Temperature Support |
|-----------|--------------------|
| Equality | ✅ Supported |
| Conversion | ✅ Supported |
| Addition | ❌ Not meaningful (absolute temperatures) |
| Subtraction | ❌ Not supported (in this design) |
| Division | ❌ Meaningless |

### Example

```
100°C + 50°C ≠ 150°C (not physically meaningful)
100°C ÷ 50°C → meaningless
```

This exposes a limitation in the previous design:

> The system assumed all measurement categories support the same arithmetic operations.

UC14 refactors the design to make **arithmetic support optional and capability-based**.

---

# Design Limitations Identified

## IMeasurable Assumed Uniform Behavior

- No way to express unsupported operations  
- Forced temperature to implement meaningless arithmetic  
- Violates **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**  

---

## Quantity Assumed All Units Support Arithmetic

```
new Quantity<>(50, CELSIUS).divide(...)
```

- Compiles successfully  
- Fails only at runtime  

**Problems**

- No compile-time communication of constraints.

---

## No Operation Capability Query

Cannot ask:

> "Does this unit support division?"

- Must rely on documentation  
- Unsafe API design  

---

# Objective of UC14

- Add **Temperature category**
- Support **conversion & equality only**
- Prevent unsupported arithmetic
- Maintain backward compatibility (**UC1–UC13**)
- Refactor **IMeasurable** safely
- Preserve **generics and type safety**
- Follow **SOLID principles**

---

# Refactoring Strategy

## Step 1 – Refactor IMeasurable Interface

Introduce **optional arithmetic support via default methods**.

### Add Functional Interface

```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface SupportsArithmetic {
    boolean isSupported();
}
```

### Default Lambda (Backward Compatibility)

```java
SupportsArithmetic supportsArithmetic = () -> true;
```

All existing units inherit **true**.

### Default Methods Added

```java
default boolean supportsArithmetic() {
    return supportsArithmetic.isSupported();
}

default void validateOperationSupport(String operation) {
    // default: allow all operations
}
```

- Existing enums remain unchanged  
- No breaking changes introduced  

---

## Step 2 – Create TemperatureUnit Enum

Supports:

- CELSIUS
- FAHRENHEIT
- KELVIN

**Celsius treated as base unit internally.**

---

### Non-Linear Conversion

Temperature conversion is **NOT**

```
value × factor
```

Instead:

```
°F = (°C × 9/5) + 32
°C = (°F - 32) × 5/9
K = °C + 273.15
```

This requires **special conversion handling**.

---

### Disable Arithmetic Support

```java
SupportsArithmetic supportsArithmetic = () -> false;
```

Override validation:

```java
@Override
public void validateOperationSupport(String operation) {
    throw new UnsupportedOperationException(
        "Temperature does not support " + operation + " operation."
    );
}
```

---

## Step 3 – Update Quantity<U>

Before any arithmetic:

```java
this.unit.validateOperationSupport(operation.name());
```

If unsupported → **fail fast with meaningful exception**

- No structural changes to generics.

---

# Example Behavior

## Temperature Equality

```java
new Quantity<>(0.0, CELSIUS)
.equals(new Quantity<>(32.0, FAHRENHEIT))
→ true

new Quantity<>(273.15, KELVIN)
.equals(new Quantity<>(0.0, CELSIUS))
→ true
```

---

## Temperature Conversion

- 100°C → 212°F  
- 32°F → 0°C  
- 0°C → 273.15K  
- -40°C → -40°F  

---

## Unsupported Operations

```java
new Quantity<>(100.0, CELSIUS)
.add(new Quantity<>(50.0, CELSIUS))
```

Throws:

```
UnsupportedOperationException:
Temperature does not support ADD operation.
```

Same for:

- subtract()
- divide()

---

## Cross-Category Safety

```java
new Quantity<>(100, CELSIUS)
.equals(new Quantity<>(100, FEET))
```

→ **false**

Runtime check:

```
unit.getClass() comparison
```

Compile-time safety:

```
Quantity<TemperatureUnit> ≠ Quantity<LengthUnit>
```

**Layered type protection.**

---

# Concepts Reinforced

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

Temperature should **not be forced** to implement unsupported arithmetic.

---

## Default Methods in Interfaces

- Evolve interface without breaking clients  
- Maintain backward compatibility  
- Powerful **Java 8 feature**

---

## Capability-Based Design

Instead of assuming operations:

> Ask unit if operation is supported.

Safer & extensible.

---

## Non-Linear Conversions

Unlike **length / weight**:

Temperature requires **formula-based conversion**.

---

## Absolute vs Relative Temperature

**Absolute temperature**

```
100°C → specific point
```

**Relative temperature**

```
Increase by 10°C → meaningful
```

This design prevents **invalid arithmetic on absolute values**.

---

## Polymorphic Error Handling

Temperature provides **specific error message**.

Better than generic:

```
IllegalArgumentException
```

---

# Backward Compatibility

Length, Weight, Volume:

- No changes required  
- Default arithmetic support = true  
- All **UC1–UC13 tests pass**

---

# Key Test Coverage

## Equality

- Celsius–Celsius  
- Fahrenheit–Fahrenheit  
- Kelvin–Kelvin  
- Cross-unit equality  
- Reflexive, symmetric, transitive  

---

## Conversion

- All pair combinations  
- Round-trip conversion  
- Absolute zero edge case  
- -40°C = -40°F special case  
- Precision with epsilon  

---

## Unsupported Operations

- add() throws  
- subtract() throws  
- divide() throws  
- Error message clarity  

---

## Cross Category

- Temperature vs Length → false  
- Temperature vs Weight → false  
- Temperature vs Volume → false  

---

## Default Behavior

- LengthUnit supports arithmetic  
- WeightUnit supports arithmetic  
- VolumeUnit supports arithmetic  

---

## Backward Compatibility

All **UC1–UC13 tests pass unchanged**

---

# Architectural Evolution

| UC | Focus |
|----|------|
| UC1–5 | Equality & conversion |
| UC6–9 | Addition |
| UC10 | Generic design |
| UC11 | Volume scalability proof |
| UC12 | Arithmetic operations |
| UC13 | DRY refactoring |
| UC14 | Capability-based design & ISP compliance |

UC14 makes the **system intellectually complete**.

---

# Final Outcome

After UC14, the system is:

- Generic  
- Scalable  
- DRY-compliant  
- ISP-compliant  
- Backward compatible  
- Capability-aware  
- Architecturally robust  

The design now supports **categories with different operational constraints** without hacks, duplication, or breaking changes.
