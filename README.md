### UC12 – Subtraction and Division Operations on Quantity Measurements
**(Date: 25 Feb 2026)**

---
### Description

UC12 extends the Quantity Measurement Application by introducing two new arithmetic operations to the generic Quantity<U> class:
- Subtraction
- Division
Building on UC1–UC11 (equality, conversion, addition), this use case enables comprehensive arithmetic manipulation of measurements.

### Subtraction
Allows users to compute the difference between two quantities of the same measurement category.

 ### Examples:
 - 5 L - 2 L = 3 L
 - 10 FEET - 6 INCHES = 9.5 FEET

 ### Division
Allows users to compute the ratio between two quantities, producing a dimensionless scalar result.

### Examples:
 - 10 KG ÷ 5 KG = 2.0
 - 24 INCHES ÷ 2 FEET = 1.0
Both operations:
- Support cross-unit arithmetic (within same category)
- Support implicit and explicit target unit
- Maintain immutability
- Provide validation and error handling
- Preserve SOLID principles and architectural consistency
UC12 proves that the generic Quantity<U> design scales without structural changes.

### Preconditions
- Quantity<U extends IMeasurable> is fully operational (UC10)
- IMeasurable defines conversion contract
- LengthUnit, WeightUnit, VolumeUnit implement IMeasurable
- UC1–UC11 functionality remains intact
- Subtraction returns Quantity<U>
- Division returns double
- Cross-category arithmetic is prevented

### Main Flow
---
### Subtraction Operation

### Method Signatures
Quantity<U> subtract(Quantity<U> other)
Quantity<U> subtract(Quantity<U> other, U targetUnit)

### Validation
- other is non-null
- Same measurement category
- Values are finite
- Target unit (if provided) is non-null

### Conversion to Base Unit
- Convert both quantities to base unit
- Perform subtraction:
  baseResult = this.baseValue - other.baseValue

### Convert to Target Unit
- Default: first operand's unit
- Or explicitly provided unit
- Round to two decimal places

### Return New Object
- Return new immutable Quantity<U>
- Original objects remain unchanged

### Result Meaning
- Positive → first operand larger
- Negative → second operand larger
- Zero → quantities equivalent

---
### Division Operation

### Method Signature
  double divide(Quantity<U> other)

### Validation
- other is non-null
- Same measurement category
- Finite numeric values
- Divisor not zero

### Conversion to Base Unit
 result = this.baseValue / other.baseValue

### Return Scalar
- Return double
- Dimensionless result

### Result Meaning
- 1 → first larger
- < 1 → second larger
- = 1 → equal

---
### Postconditions
- Subtraction returns new Quantity<U>
- Division returns scalar double
- Immutability preserved
- Cross-category operations prevented
- Works for Length, Weight, Volume
- Addition, subtraction, division coexist
- Mathematical properties respected:
 - Subtraction → non-commutative
 - Division → non-commutative & non-associative

### Testing Strategy
Comprehensive unit tests cover:

### Subtraction Tests
- Same-unit subtraction
- Cross-unit subtraction
- Explicit target unit
- Negative result
- Zero result
- Identity property
- Non-commutativity
- Large and small values
- Null operand handling
- Null target handling
- Cross-category prevention
- Chained operations
- Immutability validation
- Precision & rounding

---
### Division Tests
- Same-unit division
- Cross-unit division
- Ratio > 1
- Ratio < 1
- Ratio = 1
- Non-commutativity
- Non-associativity
- Division by zero
- Large ratios
- Small ratios
- Null operand handling
- Cross-category prevention
- Immutability validation
- Precision handling

### Concepts Reinforced

### Comprehensive Arithmetic Support
System evolves from comparison to full arithmetic domain model.

### Immutability
All arithmetic returns new objects.

### Non-Commutativity Awareness
Subtraction and division are order dependent.

### Division by Zero Protection
Fail-fast validation strategy.

### Target Unit Pattern
Consistent implicit & explicit unit handling.

### Cross-Category Type Safety
Compile-time generics + runtime validation.

### Code Reuse
Private helper methods prevent duplication.

### Validation Consistency
Uniform validation across all operations.

### Precision Handling
Subtraction → rounded
Division → raw double

### Polymorphism
Generic methods operate across all categories.

---
### SOLID & Object Calisthenics Review

### Single Responsibility
Quantity handles arithmetic logic only.

### Open–Closed Principle
New operations added without breaking architecture.

### DRY Principle
Shared validation & conversion logic reused.

### Possible Improvement
If arithmetic logic grows further, consider:
 - Strategy pattern for operations
 - Extract ArithmeticService
Current design remains clean and maintainable.

### Example Outputs
### Subtraction (Implicit Target)
 10 FEET - 6 INCHES → 9.5 FEET
 10 KG - 5000 G → 5 KG
 5 L - 500 mL → 4.5 L

### Subtraction (Explicit Target)
 10 FEET - 6 INCHES (INCHES) → 114 INCHES
 5 L - 2 L (mL) → 3000 mL

### Division
 10 FEET ÷ 2 FEET → 5.0
 24 INCHES ÷ 2 FEET → 1.0
 2000 G ÷ 1 KG → 2.0
 5 L ÷ 10 L → 0.5

### Error Cases
 subtract(null) → IllegalArgumentException
 divide(0) → ArithmeticException
 cross-category operation → IllegalArgumentException
